# Nginx Configuration Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the optimized Nginx configuration for the Nutanix VPC Orchestrator, consolidating the current multi-port setup into a single, efficient configuration with path-based routing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modular Configuration Structure
- Created modular configuration files in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`:
  - `security.conf` - Security headers
  - `ssl.conf` - SSL configuration
  - `proxy.conf` - Proxy settings
  - `gzip.conf` - Gzip compression settings

### 2. Path-Based Routing
- Consolidated all services under a single HTTPS endpoint (port 443) with path-based routing:
  - `/boot/` - Boot server endpoints
  - `/api/config/` - Configuration API endpoints
  - `/api/status/` - Status monitoring endpoints
  - `/api/dns/` - DNS registration endpoints
  - `/api/cleanup/` - Cleanup management endpoints
  - `/` - Web interface
  - `/static/` - Static files
  - `/boot-images/` - Boot images
  - `/boot-scripts/` - Boot scripts

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Centralized SSL termination with strong cipher suites
- Added comprehensive security headers
- Disabled default site and enabled only the nutanix-pxe site
- Proper file permissions for log directories

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Enabled gzip compression for text-based assets
- Configured static file serving with caching
- Implemented proxy buffering and connection pooling
- Added health check endpoints for load balancer integration

### 5. Logging and Monitoring
- Added access and error logging for both HTTPS and HTTP servers
- Configured log rotation for both application and Nginx logs
- Disabled access logging for health check endpoints to reduce log noise

### 6. Backward Compatibility
- Updated application code to support both old and new endpoint paths
- Used Flask's `@app.route` decorator with multiple paths for each endpoint
- Maintained existing functionality while adding new path-based routes

### 7. Health Check Endpoints
- Added `/health-check` endpoint for load balancer integration
- Configured health check endpoint on both HTTP and HTTPS servers
- Disabled logging for health check endpoints to reduce log noise

## Files Modified

### 1. setup.sh
- Updated Nginx configuration generation to use modular structure
- Added creation of `/var/log/nginx` directory
- Updated log rotation configuration to include Nginx logs
- Set proper permissions for Nginx log directory

### 2. app.py
- Updated all endpoint definitions to support both old and new paths
- Modified server info endpoint to reflect consolidated services
- Removed redundant redirect routes since we're using multiple @app.route decorators

### 3. Nginx Configuration Files
- Created modular configuration files in `nginx-config/` directory:
  - `security.conf`
  - `ssl.conf`
  - `proxy.conf`
  - `gzip.conf`
  - `nutanix-pxe` (main site configuration)

## Testing
- Created test script to verify configuration files exist and are valid
- Verified modular configuration structure
- Confirmed health check endpoints are properly configured

## Deployment
The new configuration will be deployed through the setup.sh script, which will:
1. Create the modular configuration files
2. Generate the main site configuration with path-based routing
3. Enable the site and disable the default site
4. Set up proper logging and log rotation
5. Configure file permissions appropriately

## Benefits
1. **Operational Efficiency**: Simplified configuration management and reduced maintenance overhead
2. **Security**: Centralized security controls and improved protection mechanisms
3. **Performance**: Better resource utilization and optimized response times
4. **Scalability**: Easier service expansion and improved load handling
5. **Reliability**: Enhanced error handling and more robust failure recovery
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing clients will continue to work without changes
